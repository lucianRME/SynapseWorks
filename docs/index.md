# SynapseWorks Documentation

This documentation covers SynapseWorks Atlassian Marketplace apps and the Synapse platform documentation track.

## Purpose
Provide a practical, vendor-grade reference for setup, operation, data handling, and support.

## Who it is for
- Jira administrators deploying SynapseWorks apps
- Delivery leads who need repeatable issue execution and decision traceability
- Compliance, risk, and security teams reviewing data handling

## Prerequisites
- A Jira Cloud site with the required SynapseWorks app installed
- Access to the relevant Jira projects and issues
- Basic familiarity with Jira workflows, issue types, and permissions

## Steps
1. Start with the relevant product overview page.
2. Use the matching quickstart to run your first successful flow.
3. Review configuration and troubleshooting pages for your operating model.
4. Review the security and data page before rollout.
5. Use the common FAQ, support, and release notes pages for ongoing operation.

## Common issues
- "I cannot find a feature in the app": confirm whether it belongs to a Marketplace app or to the Synapse platform pages.
- "I need governance evidence": use Decision Register outputs and security/data pages for audit context.
- "I need AI consistency, not only suggestions": Synapse complements Atlassian AI/Rovo by enforcing consistent execution structure (subtasks plus validation), rather than only generating suggestions.
