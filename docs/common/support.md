# Support

## Purpose
Define a consistent path for triage, escalation, and resolution across SynapseWorks documentation topics.

## Who it is for
- Jira administrators managing app rollout
- Operational owners handling incidents and user queries

## Prerequisites
- Access to Jira project and issue context
- Access to app output relevant to the issue (for example run results or creation results)

## Steps
1. Capture scope: product (`Synapse`, `Decision Register`, or `Platform`) and expected outcome.
2. Capture evidence: issue keys, timestamps, selected filters, and any error text.
3. Confirm behaviour against the relevant documentation page.
4. Raise a support request through [SynapseWorks Support](https://synapseworks.org/support/) or the Marketplace support path, including captured evidence.
5. Record workaround and resolution in your internal runbook.

## Common issues
- Missing issue keys or timestamps can delay diagnosis.
- Screenshots alone are often insufficient without filter and mode details.
- Mixed product context (app vs platform) can lead to incorrect routing.
